# Crate a new app

At this point, you go forth and create an app. In this example, we will create a Node.js app with Express as a simple example.

```
$ express <your-new-app>
```

Follow all the normal steps required to get the app up and running. This typically means changing directories into the new app folder, running `$ npm install` and then running `npm start` to start the app server.
