# Need to learn more about Gulp

The following are some interesting articles that need to be worked into this workshop Gitbook.

### Roll Your Own Asset Pipeline with Gulp

> I’ve found myself using Gulp for just about everything involving HTML/CSS/JS these days. It’s super fast, quick to write scripts for and flexible. I’m at a point now where I have a ton of projects I can just cd into, run gulp and be up and running. It’s the best solution I’ve found for delivering static assets whether for local development or production.

### Advanced Gulp File

> With gulp starting to find itself into my everyday workflow - I've started to understand its quirks and twists, and how to get along with it. My baseline gulfile.js has become a lot neater and advanced in its functionality that the one I originally developed back in March.
